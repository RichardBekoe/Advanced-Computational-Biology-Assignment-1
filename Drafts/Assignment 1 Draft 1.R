# The two models are not significantly different (0.05 threshold), so there is
# not a significant association between the selected SNP and PIK3CA expression
# after taking into account the site where measurements were performed. This
# result is different in comparison to the results in the previous findings


# Simple regression models or correlation statistics
# to assess association between genotype and phenotype, donâ€™t account for population structure.
# Therefore, more commonly used in practice are mixed effect models, which take into account
# various random effects not causal to the trait in question, such as the tissue type


# As we can see the slope is different when covariates are incorporated in the
# model. This addition modifies the estimated slope and its associated p-value,
# and highlights the number of days of treatment as a significant contributor to
# the association found. The lower p-value when using covariates indicates that
# the regression describes the data more accurately.


# We can see that there is a significant association between the SNP and X?
# expression (as before), but also between "SITE" and "SITE" and "X" expression.

# other sources. (10 points)



# POLDIP2
# The brain cis-eQTL effect for SNPs in this locus on POLDIP2 suggests that
# POLDIP2 could be the causal gene in this locus. Another overlap was observed
# in the SARM1 locus where rs35714695 and its proxies had the strongest
# exon-level cis-eQTL effect on POLDIP2 in multiple brain tissues (P = 2.32 Ã—
# 10âˆ’3). [ ref - Genome-wide association ]


# TMEM97
# TMEM97 ligands bind to S2R (Alon et al., 2017) and has a pharmacologic profile
# the same as that of S2R. Over the past few decades, sigma receptors (SRs),
# including sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptor subtypes (S1R and S2R, respectively)
# have been widely associated with aging- and mitochondria-associated disorders,
# such as Parkinsonâ€™s and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, multiple sclerosis and
# amyotrophic lateral sclerosis However, the specific role played by this orphan
# receptor family in cell biology has yet to be clarified. The 3D structure of
# TMEM97/S2R would provide understanding of the biological functions and
# mechanisms. [ref - Sigma receptorsâ€¦ ] [ref - Role of the sigma-1 receptorâ€¦]


# C9orf72
# The main functional disease mechanisms proposed have been the loss of function
# of the C9orf72 protein and toxic gain of function from C9orf72 repeat RNA or
# from dipeptide repeat proteins produced by repeat-associated non-ATG
# translation; more than a few hundred repeats represent a risk for ALS and FTD.
# The discovery that repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a frequent cause
# of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been important in understanding the
# pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Several downstream processes across a
# range of cellular functions have also been implicated. [ref - C9orf72-mediated
# ALS and FTD: multiple pathways to disease ] [ref - Molecular Mechanisms of
# Neurodegeneration Related to C9orf72 Hexanucleotide Repeat Expansion]
